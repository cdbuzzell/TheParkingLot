# TheParkingLot
Web application for a golf league where the cooler in the parking lot after the round is more important than the round itself.

Built on ASP.NET 5 and MVC 6, SQL Server.

Note: This solution does not currently include the necessary appsettings.json file and database scripts, so it won't work for you right now, sorry. I need to figure out secrets and database projects.
