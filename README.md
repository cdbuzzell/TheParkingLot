# The Parking Lot
Web application for a golf league where the cooler in the parking lot after the round is more important than the round itself. 
This is not a traditional golf league where each player has a handicap and matchups rotate each week. This league awards points each week to the (mostly team) game winner(s) and the (closet-to-the-pin) Par-3 winner(s). The game played and team members change every week: sometimes you are playing your own ball, sometimes you are scrambling with 3 other players.
Beer Duty is assigned to a golfer each week and displayed prominently on the home page as this is the single most important objective of the site: to ensure nobody forgets the beer.

Built on ASP.NET 5 and MVC 6, SQL Server.
